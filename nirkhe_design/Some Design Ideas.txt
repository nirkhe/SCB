The Chessboard (Physical) registers a move with the arduino which keeps the game time as well as display the name of the move and calculates the validity of the move. Maybe adds a beep or some sound to register proper move?

Then the Arduino transfers the move to the web server and keeps a digital copy of the chessboard and then displays them on site. It also has options for saving (and downloading?) game. There is a PGN standard for saving chess game. Also from here you can send the game to Twiiter, although this idea should have been chosen before you are running. 

Minutes of the conversation:

Shum suggests an LCD screen and all starting and selection of Twitter (yes/no) should be from the Arduino. Questions to find: How to ping a server for a response?

Plans for the week:

Alec - Search other languages and construct a backend server for the website.
Chinmay - Construct an appealing Website design (that is appealing and nice to look at)
Shum - Will not attend Friday. I will choose something for you. Think about what you want doe.
David - Check to see if Reed switches are the right option, what's the price.

Think about the Glassford Queen capture conundrum.
